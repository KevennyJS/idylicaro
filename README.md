# Hi there! I'm Idyl ðŸ‘‹
## I'm a Information Systems student ðŸ’» in Brazil ðŸŒŽ at Federal University of Sergipe :books:

- :octocat: A bit about me, I really think that learning something is fundamental to continue living my life, so I like studying technology in general, I would like to realize this more early (I think I would have created a lot of fun things). I'm not a genius and I'm not close to that, but I really believe in hard work :blue_book: (I believe and do it). I don't like studying English, but I study every day :boat:, I :heart: software engineering as its architectures to code and practices that are interesting, like techniques like TDD or model of solutions to problems to codes like design patterns, I really love it, :beginner: although I still can't understand a lot of things right now (:crossed_flags: I need experience so please invite me to help you with any project, I would like)


- :books: Iâ€™m currently learning about SOLID and Clean Architecture and Node APIs. Also, I'm learning something about TDD, design patterns, and web development .

- âš¡ I am currently a volunteer participant in a research project involving Unity3D at university!
